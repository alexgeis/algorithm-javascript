/*
DFS visits the child vertices before visiting the sibling vertices; that is, it traverses the depth of any particular path before exploring its breadth. 
A stack (often the program's call stack via recursion) is generally used when implementing the algorithm.

Following is how a DFS works âˆ’

1) Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex. Mark it as visited. Display it. Push it in a stack.
2) If no adjacent vertex is found, pop up a vertex from the stack. (It will pop up all the vertices from the stack, which do not have adjacent vertices.)
3) Repeat Rule 1 and Rule 2 until the stack is empty.

/**
 * Implementation of DFS (depth-first search) Algorithm to find the shortest path from a start to a target node.
 * Given a start node, this returns the node in the tree below the start node with the target value (or null if it doesn't exist)
 * Runs in O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, or O(b^d), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth.
 *
 * @param start  the node to start the search from
 * @param target the value to search for
 * @return The node containing the target value or null if it doesn't exist.
